# Smart Contract Framework

The smart contract framework provides consistent APIs across several programming languages that programmers can use to manipulate state on the blockchain.

The smart contract framework currently supports the [.NET Framework](fw/dotnet.md), as well as the Java framework and its respective compiler which will be released within a few months. In the future, we will also support Python, C/C++, and Go.
